# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework

This repository contains the code for the completion of all tasks within the 0x04 AirBnB clone.
Welcome to the 0x04 AirBnB clone repository, where we have completed all 13 tasks related to building an Airbnb clone web application using Flask. This project is part of the content provided by ALX software engineering program.

The purpose of this repository is to write an advanced, catchy and enigmatic README.md description in code format that provides detailed information on the completion of each task. Our goal is to make this README.md as informative and engaging as possible, so you can better understand the progress made on this project. 

## Tasks

We have completed all 13 tasks in this project. Here's a brief description of each task:

1. [0. Hello Flask!](./0-hello_route.py/)
    - A basic Flask web application that returns a plain text `Hello HBNB!` response.
This task was about creating a basic Flask web application that returns a plain text `Hello HBNB!` response. The purpose of this task was to get us up and running with Flask and to ensure that Flask was installed correctly on our machines.


2. [1. HBNB](./models/base_model.py)
    - An extension of the base model to handle future Airbnb clone objects that are saved to and retrieved from a database.
In task 1, we extended the base model to handle future Airbnb clone objects that are saved to and retrieved from a database. With this task, we established a foundation for all future tasks as we will be using this model to save and retrieve data from the database.


3. [2. C is fun!](./1-hbnb_route.py/)
    - Adds a web page to the app that displays `HBNB` but also renders a template.
The purpose of this task was to create a web page that displays HBNB, but also renders a template. This task involved using Flask's `render_template` function and Jinja2 templating to display dynamic content on the webpage.


4. [3. Python is cool!](./2-hbnb_route.py/)
    - Modifies the page to also display `is cool!`.
This task was about changing the contents of the webpage from "HBNB" to "HBNB is cool!". Here, we learned how to modify and update the contents of a Flask web page.


5. [4. Is it a number?](./3-hbnb_route.py/)
    - Adds the ability to pass a number as part of the request and display that number.
In this task, we learned how to pass a number as part of a request and display that number. We also handled situations where a non-numeric value is entered.


6. [5. Number template](./4-number_route.py/)
    - Renders a template to display the number passed into the request.
In task 5, we learned how to render an HTML template to display the number passed into the request. We also modified the template to display text and styling.


7. [6. Odd or even?](./5-number_template.py/)
    - Adds a condition into the template that changes the displayed message depending on if the number is odd or even.
Here, we added a condition into the template that changes the displayed message depending on if the number is odd or even.


8. [7. Improve engines](./models/engine.py/)
    - Improves the database storage engine to support FileStorage.
In order to support FileStorage, we improved the database storage engine in task 7. With this improved storage engine, we can efficiently save and retrieve data from the database.


9. [8. List of states](./7-states_list.py/)
    - Adds a web page to display all available states that exist in the database.
We learned how to display all available states that exist in the database in this task. We accomplished this using Flask's `render_template` function and Jinja2 templating.


10. [9. Cities by states](./8-cities_by_states.py/)
    - Updates the states page to include a list of cities that exist within that state.
Task 9 involved updating the states page to include a list of cities that exist within that state. We used the same approach from task 8 to accomplish this.


11. [10. States and State](./9-states.py/)
    - Adds a new route that displays two dropdown menus that are populated dynamically via Flask and jQuery.
We added a new route in task 10 that displays two dropdown menus that are populated dynamically via Flask and jQuery. The purpose of this task was to learn how to populate form fields dynamically using client-side JavaScript.


12. [11. HBNB filters](./10-hbnb_filters.py/)
    - Updates the states and cities page to include a user input filter using a form.
Task 11 involved adding a user input filter to the states and cities page using a form. We learned how to receive user input and filter database results based on that input.


13. [12. HBNB is alive!](./100-hbnb.py/)
    - A complete mockup of Airbnb written in Flask. This is the culmination of tasks 1-12.
This was the last task, and the culmination of tasks 1-12. We built a complete mock-up of Airbnb using Flask. This task demonstrated our mastery of all the concepts we learned throughout this project.

This project helped us to learn and apply an understanding of web frameworks, database storage, and user interfaces using Flask. These skills are fundamental in software engineering and are essential for anyone aspiring to become a world-class software engineer.
